# Predictive-Models-with-Regression-and-Classification-Models

We will use some of the algorithms to predict rain in Australia, specifically:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM

We will evaluate our models using:

1.  Accuracy Score
2.  Jaccard Index
3.  F1-Score
4.  LogLoss
5.  Mean Absolute Error
6.  Mean Squared Error
7.  R2-Score

Finally, we will use your models to generate the report at the end.
